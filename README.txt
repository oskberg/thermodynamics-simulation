Files submitted:
	- ball.py
	- simulation.py
	- equations.py
	- pa_plots.py
	- pt_plots.py
	- runtime.py

Instructions:
	All files should be set to generate some plots.

	pa_plots.py and pt_plots.py will generate the more
	complicared plots and can take very long to run for 
	advanced setups. 
	
	runtime.py is used to simply run the 
	simulation once with different configurations.

	Generally, either temperatrue or container area is
	varied to measure the effect this has on pressure.

Remarks:
	The parameters ``separations`` in the run method
	slows down the code a fair bit so do not have it 
	set to true unless this data is specifically wanted.

	The graphs produced will probably differ slightly in
	colour compared to the ones in the lab report
